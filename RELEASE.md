### CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W BSP
The CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W Kit is a low-cost hardware platform that enables design and debug of the PSoC 62 MCU (CY8C6245LQI-S3D72) and the Murata LBEE5KL1DX Module (CYW4343W WiFi + Bluetooth Combo Chip).

### What's New In This Release?
* This release adds updated linker scripts and startup code for the CM0+ and CM4 cores. The files are now in core specific directories.
* Minor updates up avoid potential warnings on some toolchains

### What's Included?
The CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W library includes the following:
* BSP specific makefile to configure the build process for the board
* cybsp.c/h files to initialize the board and any system peripherals
* cybsp_types.h file describing basic board setup
* CM4 Linker script & startup code for GCC, IAR, ARM toolchains
* CM0+ Linker script & startup code for GCC, IAR, ARM toolchains
* Configurator design files (and generated code) to setup board specific peripherals
* .lib file references for all dependent libraries
* API documentation
